= Pine64's BLE602 reverse engineering working group

== Notes

* The blobs were compiled using
  `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc_8.3.0 -march=rv32imfc -mabi=ilp32f -gdwarf -Os -std=gnu99 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fstrict-volatile-bitfields -fshort-enums -ffreestanding -fno-strict-aliasing`

* The target likely supports atomics. If so we may use `-march=rv32imafc`.

== Toolset

* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain[RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain]

* https://cutter.re/[Cutter, a graphical frontend for]
  https://www.radare.org/r/[radare2]

* Add your favorite disassembly tools here. If the tool is not free, mark it
  with (non-free).
